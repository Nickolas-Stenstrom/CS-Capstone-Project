1. Introduction

This is my PC game I made for my computer science capstone course. is heavily inspired by old school games on consoles like the Game Boy in
both it's graphics and gameplay. In the game, you take control of a girl trapped in a haunted house where you're tasked with finding three keys 
to escape! While exploring the house, you'll have to avoid enemies such as spiders, ghosts, and zombies. I built the game using Unity, and all of 
the code is written in C#. The game works on Windows computers, it most likely runs on Mac OS computers as well but I haven't been able to test it
on Mac.


2. Installation

Step 1: You can download the game right from Github by clicking the green button that says "Code," and then clicking "Download Zip." This 
        Will also give you all of the files on Github, which aren't necessary to run the game. You can delete the "Assets" folder if you'd 
        like since it isn't needed to play the game.
        
Step 2: Extract the folder anywhere on your computer.

Step 3: Open the "Spooky Retro Adventure" folder. Make sure to keep all of the files and folders together or else the game won't run.
        Double click "Spooky Adventure Game" to run the game. If Windows is showing a pop up and preventing the game from being ran,
        click "More Options," and then "Run Anyway."

  - Interacting:    Some objects in the game can be interacted with, such as doors and inventory items. You can press the E key to interact
                    with interactable objects. Some objects react differently if you have certain items in your inventory. If you get stuck 
                    on what to do next, make sure you try interacting with everything!
                 
  - Pausing:        You can pause the game by pressing the Esc key, or by clicking the pause button in the top left corner. In the pause menu, you 
                    have the option to review the game's controls and the option to quit the game.
             
  - Inventory:      Objects you pick up will be put in the inventory. You can open and close the inventory using the Tab key. The top row of the 
                    inventory is used for objects that will be lost when used. The the bottom row is used for keys that you find that will always
                    stay in your inventory. If you want to use an inventory object on something, walk up to it and press the E key.
