# CS-Capstone-Project
The repository for my 2D game project for my capstone course.

- The project title is Retro 2D Horror Game (the title isn't final).
- The project is by Nick Stenstrom
- The finished program will be for Windows, and I'm designing the game using Unity and C#.
- My project is a game.

- My project is a 2D retro and horror inspired game in which the player controls a character tasked with escaping a haunted house. To escape, the player must avoid     enemies and collect items. The graphic style will be simple and similar to older 2D style games (similar to monochrome Gameboy graphics) to make the design for them easier for me. Some of the main features would be player movement, enemies, and an inventory system. The game will be completely linear, meaning that the player would perform the same actions each time they play to complete the game. This means that there wonâ€™t be any randomization, which will make the game design easier.

- The challenges of this project will be learning how to use Unity, learning how to use C#, and learning how to create basic 2D Graphics.
